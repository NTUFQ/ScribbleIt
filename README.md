### 2LEARN
#### I am using Swift 3.0. Always good to use new staff XD.

Although a lot of resources online about iOS dev is stll in Objective-C and older version of Swift, it is not very hard to convert them to Swift 3.0.

PLS Make use of Google, Stackoverflow and Apple's documents.

-> [Apple Official Doc for Swift 3.0, to search for classes/objects/methods](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

-> [Swift Programing Language in iBook Store, free and friendly for beginner](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)

#### I also uses frameworks

-> [Alamofore to handle HTTP request](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)

-> [SwiftyJSON to deserialize JSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)

-> [Facebook SDK to login and share](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios)

ps: FB only gives Objective-C tutorial

#### some tutorials or videos i found useful

-> ["Unwind Segue" video, when you dont know to the transit between the view controllors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akmPXZ4hDuU)

-> Implementation of protocal/delegate pattern in swift

-> [Standford Swift Course 2016 video, good but only if you have time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lRx1zoriPo&list=PLsJq-VuSo2k26duIWzNjXztkZ7VrbppkT)
